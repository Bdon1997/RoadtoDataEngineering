Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. 
A user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, 
consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit.
Output the user_id and their average session time.

with Pageload as (
 select user_id, date(timestamp) as day,max(timestamp) as first_load
 from facebook_web_log
 where action = 'page_load'
 group by user_ID, date(timestamp))
 
 ,PageExit as (
 select user_id, date(timestamp) as day, min(timestamp) as last_load
 from facebook_web_log
 where action = 'page_exit'
 group by user_ID, date(timestamp))
 
 select PL.User_id, avg(PE.last_load - PL.first_load) as average_sesh
 from Pageload PL
 join PageExit PE
 on PL.user_id = PE.user_id 
 and PL.day = PE.day
 group by PL.user_id
